	   <h1>space race </h1
	   <h2> main idea <h2>
	<P> The space race took a stand in history by the U.S competing
in rivalry with the Soviet Union. This intense competition impacted our
	​economic and political well-being. The United States Spent billions of
	dollars to compete in the space race which was more than the money spent
	on housing or community augmentation, and because of that it tremendously
	affected the economy. Also, the Space Race affected
	political well-being because the U.S and Russian government went back and
 	forth fighting for domination of the Space Race.
	 </p>
	   <h3> major points </h3>
     <p>The space race was a political, economic, and technological clash
      between the United States and the Soviet Union. They were fighting
      to see who will explore space first and who was the more technologically
       advanced country. In 1957 the Soviet Union was the first country to put
       a satellite in orbit. The satellite was called Sputnik 1. Then the United
        States tried to launch their own satellite. But it exploded on lift off.
         NASA was formed in 1958. It was started because of the Soviet Union’s successful
          launch of the satellite. Then in January 1957 the U.S. put their first satellite
           Explorer 1 into orbit. In April 1961, the Soviet Union was the first country to
            put a man into orbit, Yury Gagarin. On May 25, 1961 President John F. Kennedy said
             that he wanted to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. In 1966 Apollo
             was established and it cost 25 Billion Dollars. The US was so determined to beat
             the Soviet Union that NASA quickly became one of the federal government's largest
             independent companies. They also spent 4.5 percent of the of the federal budget in 1966.

"Many leaders of each country used new ideas in the space race as campaign tactics as both America
 and USSR pushed forward. The Space Race culminated in the 1970s, with the US Apollo and Russian Soyuz
  programs. Since that time, there has been more peaceful cooperation between the US and USSR. More countries
  are now able to participate in space missions and the development of the International Space Station (ISS), which
  replaced the US space station Skylab and the Russian space station Mir."

  This boosted the U.S. dept throughout the country because NASA did everything and made huge advancements to move
  forward in the space race. According to our research, in 1966 the U.S spent 6 billion dollars on the space program
    which was more than 4% of the entire U.S. budget, going above the amount spent on housing and community development.
   By 1972, the space race became one of the most expensive national efforts in U.S. history.

     This is a conversation between the Apollo 11 astronauts and president Richard Nixon. He is congratulating them and saying this is a big deal for Americans everywhere, and how all the research has paid off. Also this was the first time Americans had talked to someone off of Earth.
